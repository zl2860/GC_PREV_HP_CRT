# Abstract
Gastric cancer is one leading cause of cancer-related deaths in China and worldwide. Infecting more than 40% of the world’s population, Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) is responsible for over 70% of all gastric cancers. We conducted a community-based cluster-randomized, controlled, superiority intervention trial in Linqu county, China , with individuals who tested positive for H.pylori via <sup>13</sup>C-urea breath test randomly assigned to either receiving a 10-day quadruple anti-H.pylori treatment with 20 mg omeprazole bid, 750 mg tetracycline tid, 400 mg metronidazole tid, and 300 mg bismuth citrate bid, or symptom alleviation treatment with single dosage of omeprazole and bismuth citrate. H.pylori negative individuals did not receive treatment. We examined the incidence of gastric cancer as the primary outcome. A total of 180,284 eligible participants from 980 villages were enrolled with 11.8 years’ follow-up, and a total of 1035 incident gastric cancer cases were documented. Individuals receiving anti-H.pylori therapy had a modest reduction in gastric cancer incidence in the intention-to-treat analyses (hazard ratio=0.86, 95% confidence interval =0.74-0.99), with stronger effect observed for those having successful H.pylori eradication (hazard ratio=0.81, 95%confidence interval=0.69-0.96) than those who failed treatment. Moderate adverse effects were reported in 1345 participants during the 10-day treatment. We did not observe severe intolerable events during the treatment, nor receive any related records during follow-up. The findings suggest the potential for H.pylori mass screening and eradication as a public health policy for gastric cancer prevention.
